# Landon's Library of Things
This is a small collection of tools that I've written to make life easy. 
Mosltly, just to solve small problems or perform silly little tasks that are 
otherwise tedious. 

## Installation
This requires cmake...and that's it. 

1. Run `cmake .`
2. Add the `bin` folder to `PATH` 
3. Add `lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

## Libraries and Programs
- `sping`
    - Search through an ssh config and ping the hostname of the provided host
- `libMOA`
    - Sometimes the `rand` library isn't all that random...This provides a more
      random number generator that generates various random types. 
    - Originally sourced from `http://www.agner.org/random/`

## TODO
    - random word generator
    - random number generator (program)
    - python array to matlab (and back)
